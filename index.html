      <!--<p>BIO</p>-->
      <p>I graduated from University of California, Irvine in 2019 with a degree in Informatics and specialization in Organization and Information Technology. My time in college has allowed me to take on different roles that required seeing various perspectives of technology such as researcher, designer, requirements engineer, and technical writer. Various college experiences gave me new views on group dynamics through my time as an ethnographer, project manager, and theater club director.</p>
      <p>My background in IT has provided me continuous involvement with various programs and devices and how users respond. This has shaped my design thoughts and how I communicate with stakeholders. I’ve learned how to get to the main issue or need and how to cultivate an answer or idea that will fulfill the requirements. IT has also fed my interest in the various roles technology has in organizations and the various uses systems have to offer. I’m ready to be able to take my experiences in IT and be able to apply them to create user friendly designs.</p>
