            <p>I'm Katelyn Allana Reyes, a UX designer and dedicated A.R.M.Y.</p>
            <p>I graduated from University of California, Irvine in 2019 with a degree in Informatics and specialization in Organization and Information Technology. My time in college has allowed me to take on different roles that required seeing various perspectives of technology such as researcher, designer, requirements engineer, and technical writer. Various college experiences gave me new views on group dynamics through my time as an ethnographer, project manager, and theater club director.</p>
            <p>My background in IT has provided me continuous involvement with various programs and devices and how users respond. This has shaped my design thoughts and how I communicate with stakeholders. I’ve learned how to get to the main issue or need and how to cultivate an answer or idea that will fulfill the requirements. IT has also fed my interest in the various roles technology has in organizations and the various uses systems have to offer. I’m ready to be able to take my experiences in IT and be able to apply them to create user friendly designs.</p>

          <p>This project is a redesign of the website Gayot.com for one of my upper division classes at UC Irvine. Within the five person group, I functioned as a project manager, researcher, designer, and technical writer.</p>
          <p>Gayot is a restaurant aggregator that aids people in finding restaurants in certain cities and provides expert reviews on the restaurants featured on their website. Interviews and surveys were done to learn about the experience of going out to eat and how people decide on which restaurant to go to. Usability tests, a cognitive walkthrough, and an accessibility evaluation were done to evaluate the current website.</p>
